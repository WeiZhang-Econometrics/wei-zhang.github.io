##### Notes
When I get stuck on my research, I find that engaging in other creative activities helps me restore my mental energy, 
and drawing is one of them. Most of my artwork consists of watercolors, colored pencils, 
or sketches replicating anime I like or some beautiful illustrations I saw online.
